# TSAI Assignment 6 - CNN Model Training Experiments

This repository contains three progressive experiments to build and optimize CNN models for MNIST digit classification, following a systematic approach to achieve high accuracy with minimal parameters.

## Project Overview

The goal of this assignment is to train 3 models with the following progressive targets:

### Experiment 1 – Basic Model Setup ✅
**Targets:**
- Build a working CNN skeleton using convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers
- Ensure the model trains without errors
- Keep parameter count under ~100k
- Achieve at least 98.4% test accuracy as a starting baseline
- Train within ≤ 20 epochs

### Experiment 2 – Introduce Regularization & Optimizations
**Targets:**
- Make the model lighter (reduce parameters closer to ~30k)
- Add Batch Normalization, and Dropout to improve generalization
- Experiment with Global Average Pooling to reduce parameters
- Target: ≥ 99.4% test accuracy within 20 epochs, parameters < 30k

### Experiment 3 – Final Optimized Model
**Targets:**
- Achieve the required benchmark: ≥ 99.4% test accuracy consistently in the last few epochs
- Train within ≤ 15 epochs
- Keep total parameters ≤ 8,000
- Use best practices: proper skeleton, BN, Dropout, proper MaxPooling placement, GAP, data augmentation, lighter architecture, and tuned learning rate schedule
- Ensure reproducibility of results

### Results Summary
- **Total Parameters:** 88,584 (✅ Target: <100k)
- **Best Training Accuracy:** 99.78% (Epoch 20)
- **Best Test Accuracy:** 99.31% (Epoch 19) (✅ Target: >98.4%)
- **Final Test Accuracy:** 99.26%
- **Training Time:** 20 epochs (✅ Target: ≤20 epochs)

### Analysis

**Achievement:** The model successfully established a strong baseline with 99.31% test accuracy, significantly exceeding the 98.4% target and demonstrating effective feature learning with a well-structured CNN architecture.

**Criticism:** Clear overfitting observed with training accuracy (99.78%) substantially higher than test accuracy (99.26%), indicating the model memorizes training data rather than generalizing effectively to unseen examples.

**Improvement for Experiment 2:** Implement regularization techniques (Batch Normalization, Dropout) and reduce parameters to ~30k by adding GAP bridge the train-test gap and achieve the 99.4% target more efficiently.

### Results Summary
- **Total Parameters:** 26,756 (✅ Target: <30k)
- **Best Training Accuracy:** 99.71% (Epoch 20)
- **Best Test Accuracy:** 99.44% (Epoch 19) (✅ Target: ≥99.4%)
- **Final Test Accuracy:** 99.41%
- **Training Time:** 20 epochs (✅ Target: ≤20 epochs)

### Analysis

**Achievement:** The model successfully achieved both key targets: 99.4% test accuracy (99.44% best, 99.41% final) and parameter count under 30k (26,756 parameters). Effective regularization through Batch Normalization and Dropout demonstrates excellent generalization with minimal overfitting gap.

**Criticism:** While meeting the current targets, there's still room for parameter efficiency improvements and the model could benefit from more aggressive regularization techniques to further reduce the train-test accuracy gap.

**Improvement for Experiment 3:** Further optimize architecture for maximum parameter efficiency, implement advanced regularization techniques, add data augmentation, and optimize learning rate schedule to achieve ≥99.4% accuracy consistently within 15 epochs and ≤8k parameters.

### Results Summary
- **Total Parameters:** 7,825 (✅ Target: ≤8k)
- **Best Training Accuracy:** 99.11% (Epoch 14)
- **Best Test Accuracy:** 99.47% (Epoch 13 & 14) (✅ Target: ≥99.4%)
- **Final Test Accuracy:** 99.45%
- **Training Time:** 15 epochs (✅ Target: ≤15 epochs)

### Analysis

**Achievement:** Outstanding success! The model achieves all target requirements: 99.47% peak test accuracy (consistently above 99.4% in final epochs), ultra-efficient 7,825 parameters (well under 8k limit), and completes training in exactly 15 epochs. The architecture demonstrates excellent parameter efficiency with data augmentation and learning rate scheduling.

**Criticism:** Minimal overfitting gap (99.11% train vs 99.45% test accuracy) indicates excellent generalization, though there's slight performance fluctuation in middle epochs that could be smoothed with additional regularization fine-tuning.

**Final Model Characteristics:** Optimal balance of efficiency and performance using depthwise separable convolutions, strategic dropout placement, data augmentation (RandomRotation), and cosine annealing learning rate schedule to achieve state-of-the-art results within strict parameter constraints.
